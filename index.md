## Labtrac Installation

When we need to Install Labtrac, carry out any training or resolve any issues we use TeamViewer. TeamViewer is a piece of software that allows us to access your system remotely, with your permission.

To install TeamViewer please follow these steps.

* Go to labtrac.com

* Click support in the upper right corner.

* Under support click ***Labtrac Remote Support Client***. This will start a download of the software. 

* Open the Teamviewer installer.

* Follow the instructions and go through the installer.

* When the installer asks for a PC name please enter your lab name to allow us to find you in our list of PC's.

* Enter a password. Please don't make this a personal password as you will need to tell the members of the Labtrac Support team.

* This Process will take 4 or 5 minutes for each PC.

Once TeamViewer is installed. The support team can then access your PC and set you up with Labtrac and any additional modules that you require.
